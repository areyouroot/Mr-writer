by A. Abdul Faheem

Dear water, why do you fall so clean from the sky,
But turn dark the moment you kiss our parched land?
Dear water, why flee our broken cans,
While you sleep in tubs that never thirst?
Dear water, why do they waste you without thought,
While mothers measure drops with careful eyes?

Dear water, why is poison poured with ease,
While finding you feels like chasing life’s own meaning?
Dear water, why do you shimmer in their glass,
But taste of rust and rot in ours?

Dear water, why do you rain with grace,
Then leave us with mud and sickness?
Dear water, why do you turn your back
On hearts that never did you wrong?

Dear water, lives are same but we end with no name.

About the poem

DEAR WATER
--   A.ABDUL FAHEEM
THE trash was left behind the slums of chennai the adyar river was poluted fully but thing were different before freedom
 it was a beautiful sorce of water and things started to change after the independence the proper government was not there so people evacuvate form one place to another not for money but for food and water
some dreams but all does not deserve it some were tricked and made more poor and rich more rich,but in this daily lifecycle of this people a small girl who was just 9 years old her name was anahita and she had many dreams and many work to do but not for herself but for others she was from one of the slums spending her daily life ,they were poor but happy when they sleep they sleep peacefully not like rich people every time scared of getting robed but every one had their own problems, asd was not alone in her family,she lives with her mother tamilselvi and her older brother sakthivel ,sakthivel had to go for work ever day for 16 hours he did not had any time for his family but he did not earn tomuch just 150 rupees perday,he was just a watch man,they had many loans from many people for their living expenes they did not had a proper shelter and some times they feel to buy which they can’t ,a usual day,asd went to school ,asd was studying in public school ,tamil did not want asd to struggle like her so she made her to study ,asd was at class 4,the govement had anounced new books for them and all were exited to learn but after they saw the condition of that books they realised the good books were sold out of the school the poor kids were scamed but they looked out of they had some place where they can study,
Not only at school they struggle but at the home many were still not educated and the struggle for the water
Con === sarab in cycle tube
Con===no water gada on road
Con ==ganda gali aur andadhun
Con –sleep till late work hard 
Con --- help each  other if that did not had any loss on them.  
See I told u to go to slum

the poor stay poor because they cant afford
