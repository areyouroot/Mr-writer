Ullu ka patta

By A.Abdul Faheem

A day began but at a corner, a son of gun had many desires and wishes, he wanted only 1000 Rs for party and some fun, one day he thought that he would go for a job.one day he stated walking in the lonely streets in search of a work with his illiterate mind asking people around him for a job.he taught of asking his brother for money, but his wife she would not allow it, because she thinks that I am still a child. yeah me, oh sorry I forgot to tell about me I am patta and I had some of the wishes and desire , I was the one who was asking the strangers yeah and then this what happened to me, two guys were standing near a gold shop and i approaching them. I was an idiot because I asked them “do you have any jobs for me” then one of the guy gave the another guy a photo and then they saw me and replied to me “yes, we have a work for you” and I just went with them and they said to me this job is nothing but keep an eye on the doll and they where willing to pay 1000 Rs for this job, I just believed and I asked them where is the doll one of them bought a small guy who was kidnaped and then they told me that this is the doll and I should see after it and I was scared because I was warned that "you can't tell this to a police” because he is a police then they left the kidnapped guy with me. I was waiting there for few hours and the job bored me I took my mobile and started to play pubg and the internet signal was weak so I turned towards the wall and suddenly smash! A log was thrown on me and when I woke up I saw the kidnaped guy was running and I chased him and at a point I caught him. he was stronger because he blow a punch on me but he did not know that I was a Kungfu learner and I beat him too, but he beat me with a rock and I lost my consciousness and when I woke up I saw he was gone I ran to the two strangers and I told them everything they bought me to that point and showed that he was there then one of them took a video and another guy, slapping me trice and at 6pm they gave me money and I went to my home then suddenly my brother hug me and asked me noting happen to you and then he spoke to me hardly and told who were they and I misunderstood and start crying and said to my brother that “plese don't tell to any one brother about this thing "and I went to my bed room and I wanted to play a game again but my phone was dead, so I took my brothers mobile and I saw that the WhatsApp was left open and it had a video I played in that video the one of the stranger was slapping me and below that video I saw a message that I need one lakh and the address was the same where I was working for 1000 Rs and the photo of the stranger showed at beginning was mine and I was kidnaped, my father told me that his name was ullu and I am his ptta that’s it,few day later I saw the guy who was playing doll (the kidnaped person) and told him every thing he said same happened to me then he said they paid them to play as a kidnaped person for 1000 rs that’s ok ,I asked him then why did u ran he said dude it was near 6pm and the curd gets over by 6 I ran and bought the curd so that when I go home my mother don’t scold me dammmmm.................
