Chapter 2 : DECEPTION OF LUST

there where different seal crafted by angel on their lords command.

few seal knowledge was given to the prophets.

sull calls them crown

there was a crown he used to say the gods thron he use it to help people by their needs

and there was a devil's crown he used it to order destruction.

when he was asked why the gods throne I serve people so they serve me on the devil's crown.

there where different creations of god

and he wants none to exist

the prophecy he lived with it he is appointed to blow the trumpet.

you and I are same,we want good to exist.
but you are blindfolded I have wide open my eyes.  - sull last words
